# FulfillME Marketplace PWA

A Progressive Web App marketplace where users post their needs with budgets, and providers pay to respond.

## Tagline
**You Need It. You Price It. They Fulfill It.**

## Concept
FulfillME.com is a straightforward online platform where everyday people post their specific needs—like services, products, or rentals—with their own budget and location details. Fulfillers (providers) browse these requests for free but pay a small one-time fee (in Kenyan Shillings) to unlock the asker's contact info and respond.
